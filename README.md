# Multiclass-Digit-Classification-with-Optimizer-Comparison

This task involves:

Building a multiclass classification model using Scikit-learn's digits dataset.
Exploring the impact of different optimization algorithms (e.g., SGD and Adam).
Comparing their performance using a loss vs. iteration plot.
Evaluating the model using a confusion matrix to analyze classification results for all 10 classes.
